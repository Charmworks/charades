IMBALANCED PHOLD
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
This model is an imbalanced version of PHOLD that can be set up to show multiple
kinds of imbalance:

Load imbalance:   Certain events or lps require more work when processing events
Delay imbalance:  Certain lps or events generate events with different delays
Msg imbalance:    Certain lps receive more events than others (WIP)


===============================================================================
LOAD IMBALANCE CONFIGURATION
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
When processing events, lps first run a dummy for loop for a number of
microseconds determined by both the lp load and event load. Currently event
loads are always 0, and lp loads are set based on the command line
configuration.

To use load imbalance the user must specify: light load, heavy load, load seed,
percent heavy, and/or load map.

--light-load, --heavy-load, --percent-heavy and --load-seed are used by load
maps to specify loads of specific lps in microseconds.

--load-map determines the specific load set for each lp based on the above
parameters. Currently there are three different maps:

1) Uniform: All LPs have their load set to --light-load
2) Blocked: A contiguous block of LPs have their load set to --heavy-load, all
            others are set to --light-load. The size of the block is determined
            by --percent-heavy, and the first lp in the block is determined by
            --load-seed.
3) Linear:  LPs loads are set in proportion to their global ID. The LP with ID
            0 is given --light-load, and the LP with ID equal to the total
            number of lps minus one gets --heavy-load. LPs in between get a
            linear interpolation of the two loads.
