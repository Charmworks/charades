To run PHOLD with default settings on N processors:
> make
> ./charmrun +pN ./phold

To get a list of available options for phold run:
> ./phold --help

This variant of phold includes the option to have two chains of events, one with
short delays, and one with long delays. This is off by default, but is included
to cause a higher percentage of rollbacks in order to see the performance
impact.

To use the two chains functionality simply specify the number of starting events
per LP that are part of long chains with the --long-start-events command line
option. This must be less than the total number of start events per LP.
Optionally you can also use the --long-mean command line option to set the mean
delay of these long events (default is 5.0 compared to 1.0 of regular events).
