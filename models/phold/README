RUNNING PHOLD
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
To run PHOLD with default settings on N processors:
> make
> ./charmrun +pN ./phold

To get a list of available options for phold run:
> ./phold --help

===============================================================================
TESTING PHOLD
===============================================================================
===============================================================================
To run tests, run ./test_script
For now all tests are based on the principle that running an instance of PHOLD
with x lps, y initial messages per lp, and an end time of z, should result in
the same number net events processed regardless of all other parameters.

In the future, a more rigorous test may be needed.

To add test cases see the example tests in the 'tests' directory. Each test
is a list of commands that should all generate the same number of net events
processed. The last line of the test should be:
Net Events Processed <x>

When each test is run, it will compare the net events processed to this line,
and fail if they don't match.
