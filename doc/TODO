Clean up style:
- brief, params, returns in header
- details in .C
- pre/post probably in .C
- in general, only stuff in header should be stuff that is tied to decl only
- Initial capitalizaion?
- When to end with a period?

Go back and add more \pre, \post, and \invariant notations where required

Re-order in documentation?
